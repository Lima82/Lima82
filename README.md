## Hi, there! I'am Marina Orlenko - a junior data analyst ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

Former HR manager in IT, I worked with a large amount of data, analysing it in the field of human resources management.

During the last year I've been taking a course of Data Analysis at Yandex.Practicum where I summarised and improved my knowledge in data analysis as well as gained all the required skills for a new role.

Currently I'm looking for an opportunity to work with big data.

It seems really exiting to me.
